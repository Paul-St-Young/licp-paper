abstract = {The authors present scalar-relativistic energy-consistent Hartree-Fock pseudopotentials for the main-group elements. The pseudopotentials do not exhibit a singularity at the nucleus and are therefore suitable for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. They demonstrate their transferability through extensive benchmark calculations of atomic excitation spectra as well as molecular properties. In particular, they compute the vibrational frequencies and binding energies of 26 first- and second-row diatomic molecules using post-Hartree-Fock methods, finding excellent agreement with the corresponding all-electron values. They also show their pseudopotentials give superior accuracy than other existing pseudopotentials constructed specifically for QMC. Finally, valence basis sets of different sizes (VnZ with n=D,T,Q,5 for first and second rows, and n=D,T for third to fifth rows) optimized for our pseudopotentials are also presented.

abstract = {The management of simulation workflows represents a significant task for the individual computational researcher. Automation of the required tasks involved in simulation work can decrease the overall time to solution and reduce sources of human error. A new simulation workflow management system, Nexus, is presented to address these issues. Nexus is capable of automated job management on workstations and resources at several major supercomputing centers. Its modular design allows many quantum simulation codes to be supported within the same framework. Current support includes quantum Monte Carlo calculations with QMCPACK, density functional theory calculations with Quantum Espresso or VASP, and quantum chemical calculations with GAMESS. Users can compose workflows through a transparent, text-based interface, resembling the input file of a typical simulation code. A usage example is provided to illustrate the process.

The valence profiles for both samples measured at low temperature are above the high-temperature ones at momentum pz≈pF, the Fermi momentum, and below at pz=0a.u., which corresponds to a narrowing of the valence Compton profiles with increasing temperature. This fundamental temperature dependence can be attributed to the variation of the lattice constant and thus the variation of the Fermi momentum with temperature when the experimental results are compared with jellium calculations of the valence Compton profiles utilizing a correlation corrected occupation number density. In addition the Li experiment shows a significant temperature dependence even for pz{\textgreater}pF, which is assigned to the diminished contribution of higher momentum components to the valence Compton profile with increasing temperature. The Li results are in good agreement with calculations using an empirical temperature-dependent local pseudopotential.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional electron momentum density $\rho$(p) in Li is reconstructed via a direct Fourier transform method which is free from functional assumptions concerning the shape of $\rho$(p). For this purpose, 12 high-resolution Compton profiles are measured, and corresponding highly accurate computations carried out within the band theory framework. Extensive comparisons between the $\rho$(p)'s reconstructed from the theoretical and experimental profiles with each other and with the true (without reconstruction) underlying computed $\rho$(p) are used to gain insight into the accuracy of our procedures, and to delineate the effects of various parameters (filtering, resolution, etc.) on the reconstructed $\rho$(p). The propagation of errors is considered in detail, and a general formula appropriate for the present direct Fourier method is derived. The experimental $\rho$(p) (in comparison to the theoretical results) shows a substantially more smeared out break at the Fermi momentum pf, and a shift of spectral weight from below to above pf, clearly indicating the importance of electron correlation effects beyond the local-density approximation for a proper description of the ground-state momentum density. The question of deducing Fermi-surface radii in terms of the position of the inflection point in the slope of $\rho$(p) in the presence of finite resolution is examined at length. The experimental Fermi surface and its asphericity is in good overall accord with theoretical predictions, except that band theory predicts a bulging of the Fermi surface along the [110] direction, which is greater than seen in the measurements; however, our analysis suggests that the set of 12 directions used in the present experiments may not be optimal (in number or orientations) for observing this rather localized Fermi-surface feature.},

The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision.

abstract = {We present a new Monte Carlo method which couples Path Integral for finite temperature protons with Quantum Monte Carlo for ground state electrons, and we apply it to metallic hydrogen for pressures beyond molecular dissociation. This method fills the gap between high temperature electron-proton Path Integral and ground state Diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Our data exhibit more structure and higher melting temperatures of the proton crystal than Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics results using LDA. We further discuss the quantum motion of the protons and the zero temperature limit. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many body trial wave functions are the key ingredient for accurate Quantum Monte Carlo estimates of total electronic energies in many electron systems. In the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method, the accuracy of the trial function must be conjugated with the efficiency of its evaluation. We report recent progress in trial wave functions for metallic hydrogen implemented in the Coupled Electron-Ion Monte Carlo method. We describe and characterize several types of trial functions of increasing complexity in the range of the coupling parameter 1.0 ??? rs ??? 1.55. We report wave function comparisons for disordered protonic configurations and preliminary results for thermal averages. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ab-initio phase diagram of dense hydrogen is very sensitive to errors in the treatment of electronic correlation. Recently, it has been shown that the choice of the density functional has a large effect on the predicted location of both the liquid-liquid phase transition and the solid insulator-to-metal transition in dense hydrogen. To identify the most accurate functional for dense hydrogen applications, we systematically benchmark some of the most commonly used functionals using Quantum Monte Carlo. By considering several measures of functional accuracy, we conclude that the van der Waals and hybrid functionals significantly out perform LDA and PBE. We support these conclusions by analyzing the impact of functional choice on structural optimization in the molecular solid, and on the location of the liquid-liquid phase transition.},
