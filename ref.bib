                   This fundamental temperature dependence can be
                   attributed to the variation of the lattice constant

                   transform method which is free from functional
                   assumptions concerning the shape of $\rho$(p). For
                   this purpose, 12 high-resolution Compton profiles are
                   measured, and corresponding highly accurate
                   computations carried out within the band theory
                   framework. Extensive comparisons between the
                   $\rho$(p)'s reconstructed from the theoretical and
                   experimental profiles with each other and with the
                   true (without reconstruction) underlying computed
                   $\rho$(p) are used to gain insight into the accuracy
                   of our procedures, and to delineate the effects of
                   various parameters (filtering, resolution, etc.) on
                   the reconstructed $\rho$(p). The propagation of

                   appropriate for the present direct Fourier method is
                   derived. The experimental $\rho$(p) (in comparison to
                   the theoretical results) shows a substantially more
                   smeared out break at the Fermi momentum pf, and a
                   shift of spectral weight from below to above pf,
                   clearly indicating the importance of electron
                   correlation effects beyond the local-density
                   approximation for a proper description of the
                   ground-state momentum density. The question of
                   deducing Fermi-surface radii in terms of the position
                   of the inflection point in the slope of $\rho$(p) in

                   length. The experimental Fermi surface and its
                   asphericity is in good overall accord with
                   theoretical predictions, except that band theory
                   predicts a bulging of the Fermi surface along the

                   may not be optimal (in number or orientations) for

                   fusion in eukaryotic cells. The function of syntaxin
                   relies on its proper trafficking to and targeting at
                   the target membrane. The mechanisms underlying the
                   trafficking and targeting of syntaxin to its
                   physiological sites remain poorly understood. Here we
                   have analyzed the trafficking of syntaxin 1A in INS-1

                   positive-charged amino acids as the minimal domain
                   required for the membrane delivery. Interestingly, we
                   found that SNARE motif-exposed syntaxin 1A mutants

                   the SNARE motif causes ER retention and complexation
                   with SNAP-25 helps the ER escape. Finally, our data
                   propose two key roles for the H(abc) domain: to
                   protect nonspecific interaction by masking the SNARE
                   motif and to participate in the clustering of
                   syntaxin 1A to the fusion sites in the plasma

                   resolution inelastic x-ray scattering experiments are
                   widely used to study the electronic and chemical
                   properties of materials under a range of conditions,
                   from ambient temperature to the warm dense matter
                   regime. We use the real-space multiple scattering
                   (RSMS) Green's function formalism coupled with
                   density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD)
                   to study thermal effects on the Compton profile (CP)
                   of disordered systems. The RSMS method is
                   advantageous for calculations of highly disordered,
                   aperiodic systems because it places no restriction on
                   symmetry. As a test, we apply our approach to
                   thermally disordered Be, Li, and Si in both liquid
                   and solid phases. We find good agreement with

                   their interplay with inelastic scattering
                   experiments. We resolve various anomalies contained
                   in the data, which were originally viewed as
                   signatures of strong dynamical electronic
                   correlations; we show that, instead, the anomalies
                   are due to band-structure effects. The underlying
                   theoretical framework in our density-response

                   theory; with this scheme we discuss the lifetime of

                   energy-consistent Hartree-Fock pseudopotentials for

                   exhibit a singularity at the nucleus and are
                   therefore suitable for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
                   calculations. They demonstrate their transferability
                   through extensive benchmark calculations of atomic
                   excitation spectra as well as molecular properties.
                   In particular, they compute the vibrational
                   frequencies and binding energies of 26 first- and
                   second-row diatomic molecules using post-Hartree-Fock
                   methods, finding excellent agreement with the
                   corresponding all-electron values. They also show
                   their pseudopotentials give superior accuracy than

                   many-electron systems. These stochastic

                   treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as
                   benchmarks against which other techniques may be
                   compared. They complement the less demanding
                   density-functional approach by providing more
                   accurate results and a deeper understanding of the
                   physics of electronic correlation in real materials.
                   The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and

                   Its modular design allows many quantum simulation

                   functions for a two-component system of electrons and

                   formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band
                   structure calculations, we analyze the use and the
                   analytical form of the backflow function from
                   different points of view. The resulting wave
                   functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte
                   Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid
                   and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas,
                   the purely analytic backflow and three-body form
                   gives lower energies than those of previous
                   calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and
                   optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to
                   energies nearly as low as those from using local
                   density approximation orbitals in the trial wave
                   function. However, compared to wave functions
                   constructed from density functional solutions,
                   backflow wave functions have the advantage of only
                   few parameters to estimate, the ability to include
                   easily and accurately electron-electron correlations,
                   and that they can be directly generalized from the
                   crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

                   experimental Compton profiles measured at synchrotron
                   radiation sources have raised questions on the
                   validity of the impulse approximation and the
                   strength of the electron-electron interaction in
                   metals. However, asymmetry and broadening can also be
                   introduced by experimental artifacts. In order to
                   address these issues we have made a systematic study
                   on simple systems using various incident photon
                   energies and different spectrometers. In addition, we
                   have performed simulations on the effect of dead time
                   and an asymmetric instrument function in the measured
                   Compton profiles. We conclude that the observed
                   asymmetry of Compton profiles of Be and Na does not
                   originate from any experimental artifacts, but is due
                   to the failure of the impulse approximation. This is
                   confirmed by quasi-self consistent field calculations
                   of the core electron Compton profiles, which agree
                   quite well with the experimental results.
