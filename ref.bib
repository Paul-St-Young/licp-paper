abstract = {In a comprehensive study, the modified embedded-atom method is extended to a variety of cubic materials and impurities. In this extension, all functions are analytic and computationally simple. The basic equations of the method are developed and applied to 26 elements: ten fcc, ten bcc, three diamond cubic, and three gaseous materials. The materials modeled include metals, semiconductors, and diatomic gases, all of which exhibit different types of bonding. Properties of these materials, including equation of state, elastic moduli, structural energies and lattice constants, simple defects, and surfaces, are calculated. The formalism for applying the method to combinations of these elements is developed and applied to the calculation of dilute heats of solution. In all cases, comparison is made to experiment or higher-level calculations when possible.},

abstract = {The problem of solving the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in a periodic lattice is studied from the point of view of the variation-iteration method. This approach leads to a very compact scheme if the potential V(r) is spherically symmetrical within the inscribed spheres of the atomic polyhedra and constant in the space between them. The band structure of the lattice is then determined by (1) geometrical structure constants, characteristic of the type of lattice and (2) the logarithmic derivatives, at the surface of the inscribed sphere, of the s, p, d, {\ldots} functions corresponding to V(r). By far the greater part of the labor is involved in the calculation of (1), which needs to be done only once for each type of lattice; (2) can be obtained by numerical integration or directly from the atomic spectra. Although derived from a different point of view, this scheme turns out to be essentially equivalent to one proposed by Korringa on the basis of the theory of lattice interferences. The present paper also contains an application to the conduction band of metallic lithium.},

abstract = {We present Compton-scattering studies on the high-momentum components of the valence electron momentum density in beryllium. The experiments were performed with incident photon energies of 29 and 56 keV with a momentum space resolution of 0.10 and 0.16 a.u. units of momentum, respectively. The temperature dependence of the Compton profile and the high-momentum components were studied within the temperature range of 40–850 K. The incident photon energy was 56 keV and the photon scattering vector was along the [110] reciprocal lattice vector. We compare the temperature dependence of the experimental Compton profiles to empirical local pseudopotential computations that take into account both thermal expansion and disorder. The position and intensity dependence of the high-momentum components as a function of temperature in solid beryllium were found to be quite small, which suggests that the valence electron wave functions in beryllium are not significantly affected by thermal disorder. This proves that the previously observed broadening of experimental Compton profiles in comparison to highly accurate theoretical profiles is not due to thermal disorder, and other reasons, e.g., correlation, need to be sought as the source of the broadening.},

We resolve various anomalies contained in the data, which were originally viewed as signatures of strong dynamical electronic correlations; we show that, instead, the anomalies are due to band-structure effects. The underlying theoretical framework in our density-response calculations is time-dependent density-functional theory; with this scheme we discuss the lifetime of the K plasmon, and the dynamical structure factor of Al. From a self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation in the GW approximation for the electron self-energy, we discuss the electron momentum density in Li. Our results and methods point to a new way of thinking about electronic excitations in real materials. The main challenge ahead is the proper treatment of dynamical correlations for realistic representations of the band structure.},

The experimentally derived Fermi momenta of liquid Ge and Sn have systematically higher values than those of the electron gas at corresponding electron densities, which indicates a non-simple metallic nature of the group IV elements in the liquid state.},

The electron kinetic energy (KE) was derived from the valence Compton profiles and its relative variation as a function of the fluid density was compared with that of the electron gas model. Reduction in the KE occurs more slowly than that predicted by the model as the fluid density decreases and an apparent deviation in the KE from the model is observed at the densities where the fluid is still metallic. These findings suggest that a fluctuation intrinsic to the low-density electron gas causes charge inhomogeneity in valence electrons in real fluid rubidium, being coupled with ionic density fluctuations.},

However, asymmetry and broadening can also be introduced by experimental artifacts. In order to address these issues we have made a systematic study on simple systems using various incident photon energies and different spectrometers. In addition, we have performed simulations on the effect of dead time and an asymmetric instrument function in the measured Compton profiles. We conclude that the observed asymmetry of Compton profiles of Be and Na does not originate from any experimental artifacts, but is due to the failure of the impulse approximation. This is confirmed by quasi-self consistent field calculations of the core electron Compton profiles, which agree quite well with the experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. High resolution inelastic x-ray scattering experiments are widely used to study the electronic and chemical properties of materials under a range of conditions, from ambient temperature to the warm dense matter regime. We use the real-space multiple scattering (RSMS) Green's function formalism coupled with density functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) to study thermal effects on the Compton profile (CP) of disordered systems. The RSMS method is advantageous for calculations of highly disordered, aperiodic systems because it places no restriction on symmetry. As a test, we apply our approach to thermally disordered Be, Li, and Si in both liquid and solid phases. We find good agreement with experimental and other theoretical results, showing that the real-space multiple scattering approach coupled with DFT-MD is an efficient and reliable method for calculating the CP of disordered systems at finite temperatures.},

abstract = {Syntaxin plays a key role in intracellular membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells. The function of syntaxin relies on its proper trafficking to and targeting at the target membrane. The mechanisms underlying the trafficking and targeting of syntaxin to its physiological sites remain poorly understood. Here we have analyzed the trafficking of syntaxin 1A in INS-1 and CHO cells. We have identified the transmembrane domain together with several flanking positive-charged amino acids as the minimal domain required for the membrane delivery. Interestingly, we found that SNARE motif-exposed syntaxin 1A mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and failed to transport to the cell surface in the absence of SNAP-25, suggesting that the exposure of the SNARE motif causes ER retention and complexation with SNAP-25 helps the ER escape. Finally, our data propose two key roles for the H(abc) domain: to protect nonspecific interaction by masking the SNARE motif and to participate in the clustering of syntaxin 1A to the fusion sites in the plasma membrane.},

By measuring the spectral function of charge carriers in quasi-freestanding graphene with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we showed that at finite doping, this well-known linear Dirac spectrum does not provide a full description of the charge-carrying excitations. We observed composite "plasmaron" particles, which are bound states of charge carriers with plasmons, the density oscillations of the graphene electron gas. The Dirac crossing point is resolved into three crossings: the first between pure charge bands, the second between pure plasmaron bands, and the third a ring-shaped crossing between charge and plasmaron bands.},

In the optical conductivity, an anomalous temperature dependent midinfrared absorption feature is observed. An extended Drude model analysis reveals that it can be connected to a sharp upturn in the scattering rate, the frequency of which exactly tracks the temperature dependent plasmon frequency. We interpret this absorption and increased scattering as direct optical evidence for a charge carrier interaction with a collective mode of purely electronic origin, here electron-plasmon scattering. The observation of a plasmaron as such is made possible only by the unique coincidence of various energy scales and exceptional properties of semimetal bismuth.},

The experimental Compton profiles are in good agreement with theoretical profiles employing the local density approximation–based band theory framework. Extensive comparisons between the computed and measured profiles, their first derivatives, and anisotropies defined as differences between various pairs of profiles show an excellent level of accord. The details related to the Fermi surface are clearly seen in the experimental Compton profiles. However, subtle but systematic direction-dependent discrepancies remain between the experimental and theoretical profiles, suggesting that a better treatment of electron correlation effects in the inhomogeneous electron gas is needed to develop a satisfactory description of the momentum density in Be. Our analysis also indicates that the effective momentum resolution in low-energy Compton experiments possesses intrinsic limitations due to final-state interactions and possibly cannot be enhanced arbitrarily by improving the instrumental resolution.},

The valence profiles for both samples measured at low temperature are above the high-temperature ones at momentum pz≈pF, the Fermi momentum, and below at pz=0a.u., which corresponds to a narrowing of the valence Compton profiles with increasing temperature. This fundamental temperature dependence can be attributed to the variation of the lattice constant and thus the variation of the Fermi momentum with temperature when the experimental results are compared with jellium calculations of the valence Compton profiles utilizing a correlation corrected occupation number density. In addition the Li experiment shows a significant temperature dependence even for pz{\textgreater}pF, which is assigned to the diminished contribution of higher momentum components to the valence Compton profile with increasing temperature. The Li results are in good agreement with calculations using an empirical temperature-dependent local pseudopotential.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional electron momentum density $\rho$(p) in Li is reconstructed via a direct Fourier transform method which is free from functional assumptions concerning the shape of $\rho$(p). For this purpose, 12 high-resolution Compton profiles are measured, and corresponding highly accurate computations carried out within the band theory framework. Extensive comparisons between the $\rho$(p)'s reconstructed from the theoretical and experimental profiles with each other and with the true (without reconstruction) underlying computed $\rho$(p) are used to gain insight into the accuracy of our procedures, and to delineate the effects of various parameters (filtering, resolution, etc.) on the reconstructed $\rho$(p). The propagation of errors is considered in detail, and a general formula appropriate for the present direct Fourier method is derived. The experimental $\rho$(p) (in comparison to the theoretical results) shows a substantially more smeared out break at the Fermi momentum pf, and a shift of spectral weight from below to above pf, clearly indicating the importance of electron correlation effects beyond the local-density approximation for a proper description of the ground-state momentum density. The question of deducing Fermi-surface radii in terms of the position of the inflection point in the slope of $\rho$(p) in the presence of finite resolution is examined at length. The experimental Fermi surface and its asphericity is in good overall accord with theoretical predictions, except that band theory predicts a bulging of the Fermi surface along the [110] direction, which is greater than seen in the measurements; however, our analysis suggests that the set of 12 directions used in the present experiments may not be optimal (in number or orientations) for observing this rather localized Fermi-surface feature.},

abstract = {QMCPACK is an open source quantum Monte Carlo package for ab-initio electronic structure calculations. It supports calculations of metallic and insulating solids, molecules, atoms, and some model Hamiltonians. Implemented real space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms include variational, diffusion, and reptation Monte Carlo. QMCPACK uses Slater-Jastrow type trial wave functions in conjunction with a sophisticated optimizer capable of optimizing tens of thousands of parameters. The orbital space auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo method is also implemented, enabling cross validation between different highly accurate methods. The code is specifically optimized for calculations with large numbers of electrons on the latest high performance computing architectures, including multicore central processing unit (CPU) and graphical processing unit (GPU) systems. We detail the program's capabilities, outline its structure, and give examples of its use in current research calculations. The package is available at http://www.qmcpack.org .},

The valence profiles for both samples measured at low temperature are above the high-temperature ones at momentum pz≈pF, the Fermi momentum, and below at pz=0a.u., which corresponds to a narrowing of the valence Compton profiles with increasing temperature. This fundamental temperature dependence can be attributed to the variation of the lattice constant and thus the variation of the Fermi momentum with temperature when the experimental results are compared with jellium calculations of the valence Compton profiles utilizing a correlation corrected occupation number density. In addition the Li experiment shows a significant temperature dependence even for pz{\textgreater}pF, which is assigned to the diminished contribution of higher momentum components to the valence Compton profile with increasing temperature. The Li results are in good agreement with calculations using an empirical temperature-dependent local pseudopotential.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional electron momentum density $\rho$(p) in Li is reconstructed via a direct Fourier transform method which is free from functional assumptions concerning the shape of $\rho$(p). For this purpose, 12 high-resolution Compton profiles are measured, and corresponding highly accurate computations carried out within the band theory framework. Extensive comparisons between the $\rho$(p)'s reconstructed from the theoretical and experimental profiles with each other and with the true (without reconstruction) underlying computed $\rho$(p) are used to gain insight into the accuracy of our procedures, and to delineate the effects of various parameters (filtering, resolution, etc.) on the reconstructed $\rho$(p). The propagation of errors is considered in detail, and a general formula appropriate for the present direct Fourier method is derived. The experimental $\rho$(p) (in comparison to the theoretical results) shows a substantially more smeared out break at the Fermi momentum pf, and a shift of spectral weight from below to above pf, clearly indicating the importance of electron correlation effects beyond the local-density approximation for a proper description of the ground-state momentum density. The question of deducing Fermi-surface radii in terms of the position of the inflection point in the slope of $\rho$(p) in the presence of finite resolution is examined at length. The experimental Fermi surface and its asphericity is in good overall accord with theoretical predictions, except that band theory predicts a bulging of the Fermi surface along the [110] direction, which is greater than seen in the measurements; however, our analysis suggests that the set of 12 directions used in the present experiments may not be optimal (in number or orientations) for observing this rather localized Fermi-surface feature.},

Based on the generalized Feynman-Kacs formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band structure calculations, we analyze the use and the analytical form of the backflow function from different points of view. The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision.

Recently, it has been shown that the choice of the density functional has a large effect on the predicted location of both the liquid-liquid phase transition and the solid insulator-to-metal transition in dense hydrogen. To identify the most accurate functional for dense hydrogen applications, we systematically benchmark some of the most commonly used functionals using Quantum Monte Carlo. By considering several measures of functional accuracy, we conclude that the van der Waals and hybrid functionals significantly out perform LDA and PBE. We support these conclusions by analyzing the impact of functional choice on structural optimization in the molecular solid, and on the location of the liquid-liquid phase transition.},
