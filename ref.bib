	abstract = {For pt.I see ibid., vol.10, no.8, p.1719 (1980). Results are presented for the Fermi surfaces and quasiparticle velocities of Li, Rb and Cs implied by three separate approximations for the mass operator. Comparison with experiment indicates that a non-local energy-dependent mass operator, previously suggested in the context of the density functional formalism, is a good approximation for simple metals. Comparison with the more commonly used local mass operator approximations show that a more accurate description of many-body effects results in a reduction of Fermi surface distortions and quasiparticle mass anisotropies by a factor of around two. In addition, a substantial electron-electron renormalisation of the average quasiparticle mass is predicted in Li and Cs despite the absence of a large renormalisation in the uniform electron gas.}

	abstract = {The de Haas-van Alphen effect is used to study the Fermi surface of BCC lithium. The lithium is in the form of a dispersion of micrometre sized grains embedded in wax in order to suppress the low temperature martensitic transformation. A full characterisation of the lithium Fermi surface geometry is not possible, but the overall distortion in area is found to be 3.00+or-0.02%, from which the radial distortion is estimated as 4.8+or-0.3%. These distortions are significantly higher than those found by the many-body density functional calculations of Macdonald and the positron annihilation experiments of Oberli et al. The authors obtain from the measurements a probability distribution of de Haas-van Alphen frequencies over the whole Fermi surface. The cyclotron electron effective mass is measured as (2.10+or-0.06)m0. This work is an attempt to improve on the earlier work of Randles and Springford by exploiting the higher magnetic fields (13 T) and lower temperatures (20 mK) now available.}

                   transform method which is free from functional
                   assumptions concerning the shape of $\rho$(p). For
                   this purpose, 12 high-resolution Compton profiles are
                   measured, and corresponding highly accurate
                   computations carried out within the band theory
                   framework. Extensive comparisons between the
                   $\rho$(p)'s reconstructed from the theoretical and
                   experimental profiles with each other and with the
                   true (without reconstruction) underlying computed
                   $\rho$(p) are used to gain insight into the accuracy
                   of our procedures, and to delineate the effects of
                   various parameters (filtering, resolution, etc.) on
                   the reconstructed $\rho$(p). The propagation of
                   errors is considered in detail, and a general formula
                   appropriate for the present direct Fourier method is
                   derived. The experimental $\rho$(p) (in comparison to
                   the theoretical results) shows a substantially more
                   smeared out break at the Fermi momentum pf, and a
                   shift of spectral weight from below to above pf,
                   clearly indicating the importance of electron
                   correlation effects beyond the local-density
                   approximation for a proper description of the
                   ground-state momentum density. The question of
                   deducing Fermi-surface radii in terms of the position
                   of the inflection point in the slope of $\rho$(p) in
                   the presence of finite resolution is examined at
                   length. The experimental Fermi surface and its
                   asphericity is in good overall accord with
                   theoretical predictions, except that band theory
                   predicts a bulging of the Fermi surface along the
                   [110] direction, which is greater than seen in the

                   may not be optimal (in number or orientations) for

                   relies on its proper trafficking to and targeting at
                   the target membrane. The mechanisms underlying the
                   trafficking and targeting of syntaxin to its
                   physiological sites remain poorly understood. Here we
                   have analyzed the trafficking of syntaxin 1A in INS-1

                   positive-charged amino acids as the minimal domain
                   required for the membrane delivery. Interestingly, we
                   found that SNARE motif-exposed syntaxin 1A mutants

                   the SNARE motif causes ER retention and complexation
                   with SNAP-25 helps the ER escape. Finally, our data
                   propose two key roles for the H(abc) domain: to
                   protect nonspecific interaction by masking the SNARE
                   motif and to participate in the clustering of

abstract = "Local density band structure and electron momentum densities have been calculated for Li and Na in ordered and disordered bcc structures using the self-consistent LMTO method. Calculated Compton profiles are found to become more delocalized by the effects of disorder and electron-electron correlation. It is suggested that the reported discrepancies between calculated and measured Compton Profiles in Li are due to thermal disorder."

                   correlations; we show that, instead, the anomalies

                   theoretical framework in our density-response

                   theory; with this scheme we discuss the lifetime of

                   many-electron systems. These stochastic
                   wave-function-based approaches provide a very direct
                   treatment of quantum many-body effects and serve as
                   benchmarks against which other techniques may be
                   compared. They complement the less demanding
                   density-functional approach by providing more
                   accurate results and a deeper understanding of the
                   physics of electronic correlation in real materials.
                   The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and
                   currently available high-performance computers allow

  abstract =      {In a comprehensive study, the modified embedded-atom
                   method is extended to a variety of cubic materials
                   and impurities. In this extension, all functions are
                   analytic and computationally simple. The basic
                   equations of the method are developed and applied to
                   26 elements: ten fcc, ten bcc, three diamond cubic,
                   and three gaseous materials. The materials modeled
                   include metals, semiconductors, and diatomic gases,
                   all of which exhibit different types of bonding.
                   Properties of these materials, including equation of
                   state, elastic moduli, structural energies and
                   lattice constants, simple defects, and surfaces, are
                   calculated. The formalism for applying the method to
                   combinations of these elements is developed and
                   applied to the calculation of dilute heats of
                   solution. In all cases, comparison is made to
                   experiment or higher-level calculations when
                   possible.},

  abstract =      {The management of simulation workflows represents a
                   significant task for the individual computational
                   researcher. Automation of the required tasks involved
                   in simulation work can decrease the overall time to
                   solution and reduce sources of human error. A new
                   simulation workflow management system, Nexus, is
                   presented to address these issues. Nexus is capable
                   of automated job management on workstations and
                   resources at several major supercomputing centers.
                   Its modular design allows many quantum simulation
                   codes to be supported within the same framework.
                   Current support includes quantum Monte Carlo
                   calculations with QMCPACK, density functional theory
                   calculations with Quantum Espresso or VASP, and
                   quantum chemical calculations with GAMESS. Users can
                   compose workflows through a transparent, text-based
                   interface, resembling the input file of a typical
                   simulation code. A usage example is provided to

                   formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band

                   analytical form of the backflow function from
                   different points of view. The resulting wave
                   functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte
                   Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid
                   and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas,
                   the purely analytic backflow and three-body form
                   gives lower energies than those of previous
                   calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and

                   energies nearly as low as those from using local
                   density approximation orbitals in the trial wave
                   function. However, compared to wave functions
                   constructed from density functional solutions,
                   backflow wave functions have the advantage of only
                   few parameters to estimate, the ability to include
                   easily and accurately electron-electron correlations,
                   and that they can be directly generalized from the

                   experimental Compton profiles measured at synchrotron
                   radiation sources have raised questions on the
                   validity of the impulse approximation and the
                   strength of the electron-electron interaction in
                   metals. However, asymmetry and broadening can also be
                   introduced by experimental artifacts. In order to
                   address these issues we have made a systematic study
                   on simple systems using various incident photon
                   energies and different spectrometers. In addition, we
                   have performed simulations on the effect of dead time
                   and an asymmetric instrument function in the measured
                   Compton profiles. We conclude that the observed
                   asymmetry of Compton profiles of Be and Na does not
                   originate from any experimental artifacts, but is due
                   to the failure of the impulse approximation. This is
                   confirmed by quasi-self consistent field calculations
                   of the core electron Compton profiles, which agree
                   quite well with the experimental results.

  abstract =      {We study lithium systems over a range of number of
                   atoms, e.g., atomic anion, dimer, metallic cluster,
                   and body-centered cubic crystal by the diffusion
                   Monte Carlo method. The calculations include both
                   core and valence electrons in order to avoid any
                   possible impact by pseudo potentials. The focus of
                   the study is the fixed-node errors, and for that
                   purpose we test several orbital sets in order to
                   provide the most accurate nodal hyper surfaces. We
                   compare our results to other high accuracy
                   calculations wherever available and to experimental
                   results so as to quantify the the fixed-node errors.
                   The results for these Li systems show that fixed-node
                   quantum Monte Carlo achieves remarkably high accuracy
                   total energies and recovers 97-99 {\%} of the
                   correlation energy.},
